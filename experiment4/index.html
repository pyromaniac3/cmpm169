			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, and Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					I was inspired by the following pieces:
					- Wes Modes’s Experiment with Historic Photos. 
					- Nagilto’s ambientsounds_work 
					- Che-Yu Wu’s Test play sound 
					- Joe DeNavas “What do you mean you can time travel??”

					From this selection of work, I felt as though I had a good starting point
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>
					I had 3 clear goals from the beginning that I wanted to accomplish.
					<li> 1. 3 clearly separate sections of the screen</li>
					<li> 2. The ability to play music when you want and create different combinations of fun sounds. </li> 
					<li> 3. Have an center point be an image moving in some way around the screen. </li>
					
					To inspire myself to work on the project I drew some characters that could be the starts of my band. 
					<br>
					<img src="./images/drumGirl.png">
					<img src="./images/micGirl.png">
					<img src="./images/triangleGirl.png">
					<br>

					From here I tried to make wes's historical figure code work for my purposes. I had to rework a lot of the 
					way the code called images. To instead of responding continuously, it was after a click.  
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>
					My Innovations were few and far between. I reworked a lot of the historical figures code. 
					This allowed me to cycle through the images differently. I would move an still image up 
					until a point on the z axis and then I would switch to the gif and start to do some if checks
					to play the related sound. I feel as though I used to many global variables but it is what it is.  

					In the end I didn't get it to where I wanted to, but I certainly did try with what time I 
					had available.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<h3><b>What part of the project you contributed</b></h3>
						<p> I created the project! Aside from some AI help with ChatGPT, I was the sole programmer.</p>
					<h3><b>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</b></h3>
						<p> For sure my least impressive work yet. I didn't have too much time this week to put into this experiment so it was all pretty rushed. But hey! I drew some cute 
							bands girls. 
						</p>
					<h3><b>Brief highs and lows</b></h3>
						<p> 
							Biggest high was when I finally took the time to write my thoughts on a whiteboard and think about what I was doing, I was able to 
							place the girls in the correct locations and set up the movement pretty easily. 
							<br>
							On the other hand, I struggled a lot to get to those points of focus on this project. My biggest low was by far getting the sound to stop playing. 
							It's such a low that I never quite figured out a good way to do it before the deadline :/
						</p>
