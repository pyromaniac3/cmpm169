				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					From Lemon’s 3d Collision Detection:
					Inspired by the Collision Detection Example from class I figured I could fairly easily make it a more interactive experience. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Currently the way it works is that it will drop the quantity of balls into the cube and then it will just spin around infinitely.
					You can’t make the balls bounce anymore, and they are sort of just stuck there. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I figured this has a solid base that I can then comb through and make something more engaging! 
					<br>
					<br>
					From p4stoboy- KUMALEON Coding Challenge Sample:
					<br>
					<br>
					This caught my attention because I think that the concept of adding a material onto your models is really cool! 
					I like the simplicity of it and how when you're refreshed it will have a different design. It also has a toon like shader to it which
					is super cool! I’ve been messing around with making toon shaders in Unity lately and 
					I think that’s another reason why this caught my eye.

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>With those as my two inspirations, I am setting off to see how I can combine it. I am planning on having the cube be my base. 
					<br>
					My initial goals are to be able to :
					[] Spin the Box
					[] Click to Shake the Box
					[] Change its shape [stretch]
					</p>
				<p>To sum it up, I was able to spin the box, but shaking was out of my leauge. I tried 
					to do some weird translation thing, but it just was not working out for me
					<br>
					<br>
					Then when I tried to make the balls have some physcis to them, it was even harder. I struggled to 
					make it happen, and was getting too frusterated. After an hour or two of attempts, I decided to 
					scrap the whole idea and go in a completely different more interesting direction.

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> Using what I learned from my other sections, I decided to find a 3D model of shrek onlin, because it was the first character
					that came to my mind. Searching on sketchfab I found a good model from HarrisonHag1 and I decided to roll with it. 
					<br>
					<br>
					I put him in the cube, gave him the normal material and kept the ADD blend mode and thought about what I could do. 
					<br>
					<br>
					The first thing to come to my mind was to put him in his swamp. I figured, he'd be spinning around because he was getting really mad at you. 
					Why does shrek get mad? Cause you are in his swamp. With a bit of tinting, and a couple of extra shreks thrown in the mix. I had a piece of art.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
						<p>I contributed everything, since I worked alone.</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
						<p>I think it was fine. I learned how to put in a model, and a bit more about how translations work in javascript.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
						<p>Lows: Everything do to with those stupid ball physics. It was so annoying that I just dropped it.</p>
						<p>Highs: The multiple shreks was pretty funny ngl. Also the Blend Mode Looks really cool.</p>
