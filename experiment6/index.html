			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars and Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>
					Immediately I was drawn to the idea of doing a grammar based project. I was in a Interactive Storytelling class previously and we worked on making a 
					highschool drama story using grammars in Step, so I have a bit of experience. The first thing that I thought could be fun to make is my 
					own personalized Drawing Prompt Generator. I use these occasionally when I don’t know what to draw, 
					so I think it would be cool to create my own that includes my personal characters/things I specifically like to draw. 
					<br>
					<br>
					A few website examples:
					
					<!-- add pictures or some shit -->
					<img src ="./assets/artpromptgen.png">
					<img src="./assets/artpromptgenerator2.png">
					<img src = "./assets/tracey.png">
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Goals for this project:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>A button to click to generate different categories of prompt like the examples in the website</li>
						<li>A couple dozen different iterations of prompts</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Grammars I Want to Have:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Character/OC</li>
						<li>In Pose</li>
						<li>With Context</li>
					</ul>
					<i>example: “Sailor Moon standing like Dio while preparing for battle”</i>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>
					First using the format from the JSON Tracery Example from the slides and Wes Modes Clickbait Article examples, I threw down some initial ideas.
					<br>
					<br>
					<!-- image here-->
					<img src = "assets/prompts.png">
				
					<br>
					<br>
					With a simple mouse click, I’m clearing the text and replacing it with something different. It’s fairly simple, but I do want to simulate buttons instead of just any mouse click. 
					<br>
					<br>
					100000% have to improve my sentence structure haha, but the idea is there. Let’s do some fun UI stuff. 
					<br>
					Pausing on the UI elements, I knew I had to have more differing responses. I was struggling to think of things outside of what I was immediately seeing, so I went to ChatGPT! To generate verbs, locations, and sentences for me!
					<br>
					<br>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>
					SO ! on my journey to make it prettier I decided to 
					<ul>
						<li>1. Give it a Button</li>
						<li>2. Give it a Menu</li>
					</ul>
					All good art generators come with an initial start menu. 
					<br>
					<!-- imagesss-->
					<img src = "assets/menu.png">
					<br>
					It’s still kind of lame tho, and the button isn’t actually mapped to only make a new prompt when you click on the “new prompt button” so it’s not even a button at all really. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Also I want the menu to be cooler. 
					<br>
					<br>
					
					I thought having something simple would be nice, I found this twinkling stars example on Open Processing

					Stars at night twinkle by Mascaria: link here: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1986668 
					<!-- imagess-->

					<br>
					Boom bada boom here we got a funny little menu screen.

					<br>
					<img src = "assets/finalmenu.png">
					<br>
					And also the button darkens to simulate a press. I had it as a mouse click, but I changed it to be a key press just for simplicity. Plus now I don’t have to track where the user is clicking! So that’s a bonus for me.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
						<p>
							I was the only one who worked on the project. So I contributed everything, with a bit of help from Chat GPT and code from Mascaria and Wes Modes Tracery example from the lecture. 
						</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
						<p>
							My work was pretty okay! I like how it came out in the end, I wish the sentences were a bit more put together, but I think it gives it a lot of charm. 
						</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
						<p>
							By far the most annoying part was putting the sentences together. I was struggling to come up with verbs and phrases and ways to split the prompts into catagories that weren't too repetivitve. 
							However, I think it came out alright in the end. The high was definitely seeing the final product and clicking through the different prompts. I had a fun time reading through the combinations. Particularly any that included the character "They".
